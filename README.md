## Hello there!

I am Frederick Katsura. I am a passionate self-taught independent developer looking to create whatever I desire and learning new things!

While I know Python (2.x & 3.x), Java, and C#. I love working with JavaScript and TypeScript the most and is the one I'm most knowledegable in. Most of my projects are programmed in JavaScript so... I hope I know at least a little bit of it. 😄

### Current Status

✍️ Developing a new Discord.js framework: [Miyuu](https://github.com/Butterstroke/Miyuu).

🔨 Maintaining and further developing my repositories. Namely [AniList-Node](https://github.com/Butterstroke/AniList-Node) and [MargarineBot](https://github.com/Butterstroke/MargarineBot)

💻 Currently doing a study semester for university. Not seeking any active job offers.
