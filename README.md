## Hello there!

I am Frederick Katsura. I am a passionate self-taught independent developer looking to create whatever I desire and learning new things!

I know Python (2.x & 3.x), Java, C#, and Javascript. But out of those four, I would say Javascript (specifically with Node) is my favourite to play around with and the one I am most comfortable with!

### Current Status

✍️ Developing a new project using Kotlin.

🔨 Maintaining and further developing my repositories. Namely [AniList-Node](https://github.com/Butterstroke/AniList-Node) and [MargarineBot](https://github.com/Butterstroke/MargarineBot)

💻 Working full time as a Co-op Software Developer.
