## Hello there!

I am Frederick Katsura. I am a passionate self-taught independent developer looking to create whatever I desire and learning new things!

While I know Python (2.x & 3.x), Java, and C#. I love working with JavaScript and TypeScript the most and is the one I'm most knowledegable in. Most of my projects are programmed in JavaScript so... I hope I know at least a little bit of it. 😄

### Current Status

✍️ Developing a new Angular application called Myneworm.

🔨 Maintaining and further developing my repositories like [AniList-Node](https://github.com/Butterstroke/AniList-Node) & [MargarineBot](https://github.com/Butterstroke/MargarineBot)

💻 Working full time as a Co-op Software Developer.
