## Hello there!

I am Frederick Katsura. I am a passionate self-taught independent developer looking to create whatever I desire and learning new things!

I know Python (2.x & 3.x), Java, C#, and Javascript. But out of those four, I would say Javascript (specifically with Node) is my favourite to play around with and the one I am most comfortable with!

### Current Status

✍️ Developing a new project using Kotlin.

🔨 Maintaining and further developing my repositories. Namely [AniList-Node](https://github.com/Butterstroke/AniList-Node) and [MargarineBot](https://github.com/Butterstroke/MargarineBot)

💻 Currently looking for a full-time computer science co-op job for September-December 2021. Open to physical jobs in Halifax, Nova Scotia and remotely everywhere else. Have a job that matches? Send me an email at <a href="mailto:katsurinstudios@protonmail.ch">katsurinstudios@protonmail.ch</a>
