## Hello there!

I am Frederick Katsura. I am a passionate, self-taught developer looking to create whatever I desire and learn new things!

While I know Python, Java, and C#, my main languages are JavaScript and TypeScript. Both of them are the ones I'm most knowledgable in and love to work with the most so most of my projects tend to be developed in them. I also know HTML, CSS, Angular, PostgreSQL, Express.js, etc... so I'm pretty flexible when it comes to application work. 😄

### Current Status

✍️ Developing a new Angular application called Myneworm.

🔨 Maintaining and further developing my repositories like [AniList-Node](https://github.com/Butterstroke/AniList-Node)

💻 Currently completing another semester of university. Not seeking any employment at the moment.
