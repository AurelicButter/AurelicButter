## Hello there!

I am Frederick Katsura. I am a passionate, self-taught developer looking to create whatever I desire and learn new things!

Since 2017, when I first started open source development, I've learned a lot of skills including Python, Java, C#, and my personal favourites JavaScript and TypeScript. So much of a personal favourite, I tend to work with JavaScript and TypeScript and end up having most of my projects using either of them! I also have picked up many other skills along the way such as HTML, CSS, Angular, PostgreSQL, and Express.js. So wherever my project's needs take me, I am flexible and ready to create! 😄

### Current Status

✍️ Developing a new Angular application called Myneworm.

🔨 Maintaining and further developing my repositories like [AniList-Node](https://github.com/Butterstroke/AniList-Node)

💻 Actively seeking full-time employment for a software developer position starting in January 2023. All offers, reach out via my email: <a href="mailto:fkatsura@katsurin.com">fkatsura@katsurin.com</a>.
