## Hello there!

I am Frederick Katsura. I am a passionate, self-taught developer who is excited to learn new things and create the next piece of software!

Since 2017, I have fueled this passion through open source development; creating and supporting my own projects. From simple automation scripts in Python to website building with Angular and TypeScript, I have yet to see a project that is too large or too complicated for me to say no to! And while projects change from month to month, my passion with my projects lead me to develop countless other skills like Java, C#, JavaScript (a personal favourite!), PostgreSQL, Express.js, Linux, etc... You name it, I have probably tried it! Whatever my projects need from me, I'm always there, ready to create! 😄

### Current Status

✍️ Developing my latest project, a website called [Myneworm](https://github.com/Butterstroke/Myneworm) and its API. It's available right now for anyone to sign up and use at https://myneworm.katsurin.com!

🔨 Maintaining and further developing my repositories like [AniList-Node](https://github.com/Butterstroke/AniList-Node)
