## Hello there!

I am Frederick Katsura, a passionate, self-taught developer who loves going from designing to creating the next piece of software!

Since 2017, I have fueled a passion for software development through my open source projects. From simple automation scripts in Python to website building with Angular and TypeScript, I have yet to see a project that is too large or too complicated for me to say no to! And while projects change from month to month, my passion with my projects lead me to develop countless other skills like Java, C#, JavaScript (a personal favourite!), PostgreSQL, Express.js, Linux, etc... You name it, I have probably tried it! Whatever my projects need from me, I'm always there, ready to create! 😄

Currently, I am improving upon [Myneworm](https://myneworm.katsurin.com), the premier website dedicated to tracking and staying updated on English-translated light novels and manga releases. I work over the entire stack from Angular front-end ([GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Butterstroke/Myneworm)) to TypeScript/Express.js API and beyond. I'm also maintaining other repositories of mine like [AniList-Node](https://github.com/Butterstroke/AniList-Node).
